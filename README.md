This app is still in very early dev so things are not setup for proper usage please beware.

Collegram is an experimental percussive synthesizer made with javascript

Concept of the application

    Hide as much parameters from the user as possible.
    Make heavy use of random based generative approach for sound synthesis.
    The system should make it easy to navigate a wide range of sonic experiences very fast.
    Reduce the amount of technical investment spent on producing interesting sonic ideas.

How To operate the app:
    - !!!watch out for the volume if using headphones!!!
    -Hit "spacebar" for playback/pause
    -click the mouse button to generate a new set of sound
    -press the "q" key on your keyboard to generate a new rythmic sequence

TODO:
    -fine tune synthesis chain and parameter generation for a wide range of exotic percussion sounds
    -add snapshot system that can save set of sound and set of rythms independantly
    -add .wav export function
    -create a pleasing UI
