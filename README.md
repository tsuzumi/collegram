Collegram is an experimental percussive synthesizer made with javascript

Concept of the application

    hide as much parameters from the user as possible
    make heavy use of random based generativ approach for sound synthesis
    the system should make it easy to navigate a wide range of sonic experiences very fast
    reduce the amount of technical investment spent on producing interesting rythmic sonic ideas

How To operate the app:
    -click the mouse button to generate a new set of sound
    -press the "q" key on your keyboard to generate a new rythmic sequence

TODO:
    -fine tune synthesis chain and parameter generation for a wide range of exotic percussion sounds
    -add snapshot system that can save set of sound and set of rythms independantly
    -add .wav export function
    -create a pleasing UI
